# Task 001: Initial Project Setup and Implementation Planning

## Objective

Set up the CodeJangler project structure and create a detailed implementation plan.

## Steps Taken

1. Initial Project Creation

   ```bash
   crewai create crew pr_optimizer
   ```

   - Selected Gemini as the provider
   - Generated initial project structure

2. Project Configuration Issues

   - First attempt to install package failed due to missing LICENSE file
   - Created MIT LICENSE file to resolve dependency issue

3. Package Configuration Updates

   - Modified pyproject.toml to:
     - Update package name to "codejangler"
     - Add proper dependencies
     - Configure development tools
     - Set up tool configurations (black, isort, mypy, etc.)

4. Agent Configuration

   - Replaced default agents with specialized PR optimization agents:
     - PR Analyzer: Code analysis and split point identification
     - PR Splitter: Git operations and PR creation
     - PR Reviewer: Quality validation and review management
   - Added tool assignments to each agent
   - Configured sequential task workflow

5. Tool Implementation

   - Created three core tool modules:
     - git_tools.py: Repository and branch management
     - code_analysis.py: Code structure and dependency analysis
     - github_api.py: GitHub integration and PR management
   - Implemented proper CrewAI tool patterns
   - Added input validation using Pydantic models

6. CLI Interface Setup
   - Updated main.py with Click-based CLI
   - Added commands:
     - optimize: Main PR optimization workflow
     - train: Model training functionality
     - replay: Task replay capability
     - test: Testing interface

## Issues Encountered

1. Package Installation

   - Initial failure due to missing LICENSE file
   - Resolution: Created LICENSE file with MIT license

2. Project Structure

   - CrewAI default structure needed significant modification
   - Resolution: Reorganized for PR optimization workflow

3. Tool Integration
   - Initial tool implementation didn't follow CrewAI patterns
   - Resolution: Refactored to use BaseTool and proper schemas

## Current Status

- ✅ Project structure complete
- ✅ Configuration files in place
- ✅ Agent definitions established
- ✅ Tool frameworks implemented
- ✅ Implementation plan created

## Next Steps

1. Begin PR Analysis Implementation

   - Diff parsing system
   - Dependency graph builder
   - Test coverage analyzer

2. Set up Testing Infrastructure

   - Unit tests for core components
   - Integration tests for GitHub operations
   - End-to-end workflow tests

3. Implement CLI Functionality
   - Progress reporting
   - Error handling
   - Configuration management

## Lessons Learned

1. Project Setup

   - Always create LICENSE and README files first
   - Verify all required configuration files before package installation

2. CrewAI Integration

   - Follow CrewAI patterns strictly for tools and agents
   - Use proper type hints and schemas
   - Implement proper error handling

3. Development Process
   - Start with clear agent and tool definitions
   - Implement proper validation early
   - Focus on maintainable structure

## Time Spent

- Project Setup: 30 minutes
- Configuration: 45 minutes
- Tool Implementation: 1.5 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
- Total: ~4 hours
