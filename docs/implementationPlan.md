## Implementation Details

### 1. PR Analysis System

#### 1.1 Diff Parsing
```python
class DiffParser:
    def parse_changes(self, diff_content: str) -> Dict[str, List[Change]]:
        # Parse git diff to extract:
        # - Modified files
        # - Function/class changes
        # - Line-level modifications
        pass
```

#### 1.2 Dependency Analysis
```python
class DependencyAnalyzer:
    def build_graph(self, changes: Dict[str, List[Change]]) -> DependencyGraph:
        # Analyze code to identify:
        # - Import dependencies
        # - Function calls
        # - Class relationships
        pass
```

#### 1.3 Test Coverage
```python
class TestAnalyzer:
    def analyze_coverage(self, changes: Dict[str, List[Change]]) -> CoverageReport:
        # Determine:
        # - Affected tests
        # - Coverage gaps
        # - Test dependencies
        pass
```

### 2. Split Strategy Engine

#### 2.1 Change Grouping
```python
class ChangeGrouper:
    def group_changes(self, 
                     changes: Dict[str, List[Change]], 
                     dependencies: DependencyGraph) -> List[ChangeGroup]:
        # Group changes based on:
        # - Logical relationships
        # - Dependency chains
        # - Test coverage
        pass
```

#### 2.2 Branch Management
```python
class BranchManager:
    def create_split_branches(self, 
                            groups: List[ChangeGroup], 
                            base_branch: str) -> List[str]:
        # Handle:
        # - Branch creation
        # - Commit cherry-picking
        # - Conflict resolution
        pass
```

### 3. Validation System

#### 3.1 Build Verification
```python
class BuildVerifier:
    def verify_builds(self, branches: List[str]) -> Dict[str, BuildResult]:
        # For each split:
        # - Run builds
        # - Check for errors
        # - Verify dependencies
        pass
```

#### 3.2 Test Validation
```python
class TestValidator:
    def validate_coverage(self, 
                         branches: List[str], 
                         original_coverage: CoverageReport) -> ValidationReport:
        # Ensure:
        # - All tests pass
        # - Coverage maintained
        # - No regressions
        pass
```
